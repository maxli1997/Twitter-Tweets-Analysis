1,1,2.0,0.969,"data, website, ai, good, ashland, month, past, drive, government, brings",hello guys where to find the tender info for global tenders like the government bidding website or other website our business mainly focus on data collection and data annotation for ai adas industry thanks a lot data computer version self-driving ai

6,6,9.0,0.91,"tesla, still, self, better, good, almost, safer, order, non, future",who reaches full level 5 self driving first tesla autopilot or a baby born today
7,7,0.0,0.9625,"much, data, think, tesla, less, breakup, highways, highway, cars, applications", we should closely think about this data autopilot in its current form works well only on freeways/highways cars are less likely to collide when driving in their own lane imo stress free highway driving in itself is very useful but tesla should breakup this data by road type 
8,8,7.0,0.9679,"highway, apples, stats, via, posture, proper, school, city, feature, comparison", yeah fair point love to see stats on apples to apples comparison if autopilot stats are from highway only active safety feature and wo either should also come from highway only but is autopilot stats only from highway driving i'm pretty sure i've seen videos of city street
9,9,8.0,0.9526,"tesla, self, full, hug, age, comma, much, love, stats, thing", i find such joy in driving the model s so passive autopilot features are greatly appreciated when im tired or anxious i e stop and go traffic navigate on autopilot is the best i am a safer driver because of tesla 
10,10,6.0,0.9357,"safer, safety, driven, million, tesla, ap, drinking, one, every, accident", most autopilot driving is done on freeways which is statistically safer than other road driving therefore it cannot be correlated that autopilot is safer than the excellent standard tesla safety system 
11,11,6.0,0.95,"safer, safety, driven, million, tesla, ap, drinking, one, every, accident", and this stat will continue to trend favoring autopilot humans tend not to learn from mistakes i e texting and driving drinking and drinking etc while developers and engineers can make continuous improvements to the autopilot system 
12,12,1.0,0.9609,"love, fsd, day, apples, drive, see, unless, deliveries, handling, kinda", is this an apples-to-apples comparison teslas autopilot feature is only engaged in straight line driving on the highway whereas the nhtsa data incorporates all kinds of driving including more dangerous driving like left-hand turns city driving etc 
13,13,6.0,0.9591,"safer, safety, driven, million, tesla, ap, drinking, one, every, accident", we know that most driven mileage on autopilot driving is currently done as freeway driving and statistically we know that freeway driving is much safer than other roads therefore the inference that autopilot is safer than teslas standard safety suite cannot be supported 
14,14,9.0,0.9357,"tesla, still, self, better, good, almost, safer, order, non, future",to conclude you are almost 10x safer driving a tesla on autopilot than you are driving a non tesla without autopilot order now at to order the safest cars ever built 
15,15,8.0,0.8875,"tesla, self, full, hug, age, comma, much, love, stats, thing", agree 100% autopilot does not equal full self driving or full self flying 
16,16,9.0,0.9308,"tesla, still, self, better, good, almost, safer, order, non, future", as autopilot/fsd get better and better at collision avoidance will those safety enhancements continue to roll down to passive autopilot/manual driving 
17,17,6.0,0.9526,"safer, safety, driven, million, tesla, ap, drinking, one, every, accident", thats the amazing thing people dont think about passive autopilot even when youre driving manually autopilot is looking out for you if it knows how to stay in the lane itself it can detect when youre drifting out on manual driving so exciting 
18,18,8.0,0.9471,"tesla, self, full, hug, age, comma, much, love, stats, thing", i'm in love with tesla but autopilot is around 6 years old and already driving think i may just have to wait til autopilot turns the legal age to get their temps at the age of 16
19,19,9.0,0.9667,"tesla, still, self, better, good, almost, safer, order, non, future", i suspect tesla's - evs in general - to be driven more yearly due to lower marginal costs hence dampening this positive effect on tesla insurance still autopilot is literally a life-saver and should be in every car driving 100% manually should become a thing of the past
20,20,9.0,0.9471,"tesla, still, self, better, good, almost, safer, order, non, future", looks like some kind of survivorship bias logical mistake if we driving unsafe places we do it on our own but if we are going straight highway we do it by autopilot more miles - yes but that miles are safe by themselves 
21,21,2.0,0.8714,"data, website, ai, good, ashland, month, past, drive, government, brings", does this compensate for autopilot being used primarily on the highway vs all types of driving 
22,22,9.0,0.8875,"tesla, still, self, better, good, almost, safer, order, non, future",wow driving with autopilot engaged is almost 10x safer than the average non-tesla 
23,23,6.0,0.964,"safer, safety, driven, million, tesla, ap, drinking, one, every, accident",for q1 2021 tesla registered one accident for every 4 20 million miles driven in which drivers had autopilot engaged for those driving manually but with ap active safety features one accident for every 2 05 million miles driven twice as safe with ap on 
24,24,9.0,0.7,"tesla, still, self, better, good, almost, safer, order, non, future",tesla autopilot is future of driving 
25,25,0.0,0.9654,"much, data, think, tesla, less, breakup, highways, highway, cars, applications", just to play devil's advocate i have a salvage tesla model 3 didn't give musk any $$ it has autopilot wow i didn't think i'd love it as much as i do i have rsi and driving long distance is hard ap makes it so much easier also much much safer if used while driving 
26,26,1.0,0.9654,"love, fsd, day, apples, drive, see, unless, deliveries, handling, kinda", agreed i love autopilot too but i would never pay $10k to not drive my car i love driving while i see huge value for automation of trucking deliveries so on in day to day driving fsd is kinda pointless to me unless it's a crap handling toyota then fsd is fine 
27,27,9.0,0.9471,"tesla, still, self, better, good, almost, safer, order, non, future",this was not my experience on a 500 km roadtrip i hope autopilot will handle straighter and less construction ridden roads better in the future i prefer driving myself still maybe v 11 can change that 
28,28,9.0,0.9571,"tesla, still, self, better, good, almost, safer, order, non, future","no it is a good idea why tesla's ""full self driving"" is still at level 2 and musk is fos on lidar this billboard that confuses tesla autopilot is a good reminder of why self-driving is still a long way off via "
29,29,9.0,0.97,"tesla, still, self, better, good, almost, safer, order, non, future", 65% of accidents can be attributed to fatigue thus autopilot will drastically improve safety you cant get to zero trees fall over people driving buses have heart attacks motorbikes hit pot holes us trains cant move 90 000 persons per minute as not enough track 
30,30,5.0,0.9625,"drive, medford, school, rain, via, granted, times, year, recently, way", i have a partner who lives in oregon who i visit many times throughout the year this same drive granted less recently because of covid ashland/medford are beautiful and stopping in medford tonight on the way up autopilot makes driving those 16+ hours possible 
31,31,2.0,0.955,"data, website, ai, good, ashland, month, past, drive, government, brings", what brings you up to northern oregon did that twice in the past month both via ashland/medford and klamath falls both good routes such a good drive made so much easier with autopilot safe driving 
32,32,9.0,0.9182,"tesla, still, self, better, good, almost, safer, order, non, future",this billboard that confuses tesla autopilot is a good reminder of why self-driving is still a long way off via 
33,33,8.0,0.964,"tesla, self, full, hug, age, comma, much, love, stats, thing", i own both tesla and comma2 driving with comma2 is definitely more chill the only thing i like about autopilot is keeping the speed limit set regardless including travelling downhill hate autopilot autosteer prioritizes to hug right lane line and hug too much left on turning
34,34,6.0,0.8098,"safer, safety, driven, million, tesla, ap, drinking, one, every, accident",autopilot full self driving blue cruise the elon in the machine super driver i don't care what they call it i just want an automous driving solution that can rip around the track at buttonwillow in record time gimme all the adrenalines please k thanks
