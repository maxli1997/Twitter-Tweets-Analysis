0,0,0.0,0.95,"highway, full, using, huawei, markings, door, use, like, self, year","huawei's door to door 'autopilot' on the 2021 arcfox as hbt ""using huawei's full stack this year we can deliver real urban roads high-end autonomous driving"" adas "
1,1,8.0,0.9471,"possible, ap, best, better, also, safer, ford, dms, experience, algo", also to he clear i am not arguing that adas systems are not making driving safer of course they do and ap is one of the best i am just not a fan of spewing idiotic numbers without scrutiny 
2,2,4.0,0.9571,"safer, tesla, self, good, walk, long, way, via, reminder, billboard",infrastructure is important but what about having over-hyped level-2 adas systems on the road that are marketed by tesla as self driving good to hear you are not going to accept crashes as inevitable will you make walk the walk talk is cheap 
3,3,0.0,0.955,"highway, full, using, huawei, markings, door, use, like, self, year", i think autopilot is a good name for what it does i thought full self driving as a kind of kickstarter / pre-order for a hypothetical future l3+ mode was justifiable i do not agree with them using that terminology to describe l2 / adas functionality as they do now 
4,4,3.0,0.9526,"car, seat, auto, tesla, add, evolved, agree, everywhere, cities, belt",before the 2021 auto shanghai one of china's biggest auto shows qualcomm and partners discussed about c-v2x evolved driving experience opportunities for new and established car makers adas 5g etc 
5,5,3.0,0.7,"car, seat, auto, tesla, add, evolved, agree, everywhere, cities, belt",doge driving tesla autopilot 
6,6,7.0,0.775,"self, safer, full, tesla, musk, car, driver, human, data, road", autopilot with tesla is safer than driving your car 
7,7,3.0,0.9609,"car, seat, auto, tesla, add, evolved, agree, everywhere, cities, belt", which do you think has killed more people tesla autopilot or radio knobs interesting that you can accept the risk posed by the latter if every feature added to a car required a beta test that guaranteed no fatalities we'd be driving golf carts 
8,8,2.0,0.5709,"self, driver, features, vehicle, hands, prepared, moment, wheel, capability, fully", note autopilot and full self-driving capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment while these features are designed to become more capable over time /1
9,9,4.0,0.7,"safer, tesla, self, good, walk, long, way, via, reminder, billboard", autopilot is safer than normal driving 
10,10,2.0,0.94,"self, driver, features, vehicle, hands, prepared, moment, wheel, capability, fully", autopilot and full self-driving capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment while these features 
11,11,2.0,0.9471,"self, driver, features, vehicle, hands, prepared, moment, wheel, capability, fully", are you for real autopilot and full self-driving capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment while these features are de 
12,12,1.0,0.9471,"representative, miles, tesla, highway, musk, engaged, city, aid, vehicle, ap"," this is clearly and certainly not tesla's fault elon musk warned us a few years ago that autopilot is a ""driving aid"" so it can be thought of as a gps or other electronics available on a vehicle "
13,13,0.0,0.91,"highway, full, using, huawei, markings, door, use, like, self, year", but is that usa data for highway driving most autopilot use is solely highway driving i believe anyway when i use it 
14,14,5.0,0.85,"much, actual, relaxed, long, also, work, legs, effort, say, distance", autopilot is just an advanced cruise control totally different than full self driving beta 
15,15,9.0,0.9571,"fsd, users, capable, tracks, day, beta, car, tesla, perfect, time", fsd beta users also have the in car camera that tracks what they are doing tesla has revoked fsd for some users who abused the system fsd is capable of driving anywhere in any weather its not perfect but its night and day better then autopilot 
16,16,7.0,0.955,"self, safer, full, tesla, musk, car, driver, human, data, road"," yes but technically the feature is called ""autopilot"" - the ""full self driving"" option is an extra you can buy that is the future promise of full self driving although it is not out yet i agree that it can cause confusion though"
17,17,7.0,0.9,"self, safer, full, tesla, musk, car, driver, human, data, road",tesla's autopilot is not an autonomous driving system and requires constant attention to the road while in use engr494 
18,18,3.0,0.9471,"car, seat, auto, tesla, add, evolved, agree, everywhere, cities, belt", i agree unfortunately the car does assume someone is in the driver's seat as long as the seat belt is buckled so by climbing out of the seat after engaging autopilot the car will keep driving 
19,19,6.0,0.9526,"capable, self, still, car, would, full, true, importantly, things, doubled"," we said autopilot"" suggests the car can drive itself more importantly stop itself doubled down w/ full self-driving again that leads consumers to believe the vehicle is capable of doing things it is not capable of doing still true "
20,20,2.0,0.9471,"self, driver, features, vehicle, hands, prepared, moment, wheel, capability, fully", no ford vehicle with bluecruise as its currently planned and promoted will drive itself its not self-driving its sae level 2 - the same as autopilot and super cruise the driver needs to be paying attention and in control of the vehicle at all times 
21,21,4.0,0.9182,"safer, tesla, self, good, walk, long, way, via, reminder, billboard",this billboard that confuses tesla autopilot is a good reminder of why self-driving is still a long way off via 
22,22,6.0,0.9308,"capable, self, still, car, would, full, true, importantly, things, doubled",probably too late to correct the public perception that autopilot = self driving car they need to add eye tracking like super cruise 
23,23,8.0,0.9591,"possible, ap, best, better, also, safer, ford, dms, experience, algo", its possible ford has a better dms for now its also possible fords bluecruise will be as good as an average human at driving on highways and its possible that will make it inferior to autopilot on the whole of ap is better at avoiding accidents all of these can be true 
24,24,7.0,0.9571,"self, safer, full, tesla, musk, car, driver, human, data, road","elon musk's cultists are predictably blaming the driver for the latest tesla autopilot deaths they are eager to absolve musk of responsibility for his claims of ""full self driving"" and ""10 times safer"" $tsla $tslaq "
25,25,0.0,0.85,"highway, full, using, huawei, markings, door, use, like, self, year",autopilot with no lane markings old technology doing an incredible job driving 
26,26,3.0,0.955,"car, seat, auto, tesla, add, evolved, agree, everywhere, cities, belt", and to add are these miles from this study comparable to each other autopilot is more likely to be engaged on well marked and spacious highways whereas normal driving can be everywhere else like cities with complicated and risky intersections 
27,27,8.0,0.94,"possible, ap, best, better, also, safer, ford, dms, experience, algo", fair enough but my own experience with autopilot is changing with continuous ota updates ap has improved so that now i use it in over 60% of my city driving a year ago 10% at best 
28,28,7.0,0.9609,"self, safer, full, tesla, musk, car, driver, human, data, road", no its currently saying human + autopilot is safer not just autopilot is safer the safety report specifically mentions driver with autopilot until we get full self driving miles data the current data implies that autopilot with human oversight is much safer 
29,29,0.0,0.925,"highway, full, using, huawei, markings, door, use, like, self, year", it seems likely that autopilot was engaged in easy driving conditions e g highway with well-defined lane markings how do your statistics account for that 
30,30,0.0,0.955,"highway, full, using, huawei, markings, door, use, like, self, year", imho numbers should be per collision type autopilot shall be superior in each one and looks like manual driving still safely avoid stationary objects like flipped cars 
31,31,8.0,0.9308,"possible, ap, best, better, also, safer, ford, dms, experience, algo", impressive i've been driving 35 years never had accident yet you should hire and put me as an the autopilot algo in your cars will improve safery record 1000% 
32,32,4.0,0.8714,"safer, tesla, self, good, walk, long, way, via, reminder, billboard", tesla autopilot is 10 times safer than humans driving in the latest study 
33,33,1.0,0.955,"representative, miles, tesla, highway, musk, engaged, city, aid, vehicle, ap", fantastic if the miles are comparable i never have my autopilot engaged in tricky situations or city driving only highway and freeway driving it means the ap statistics doesn't get representative miles from me atleast and i think i am representative 
34,34,6.0,0.9308,"capable, self, still, car, would, full, true, importantly, things, doubled", that would mean that the data for driving without autopilot would be biased down to compensate for that but these are still significantly better than the national average 
35,35,7.0,0.775,"self, safer, full, tesla, musk, car, driver, human, data, road",10x safer with autopilot now imagine self driving 
36,36,5.0,0.9571,"much, actual, relaxed, long, also, work, legs, effort, say, distance", no not even close i'd say supervising autopilot takes about 30% of the effort of actual driving you don't realize how much work your arms legs are doing until you use autopilot on a long distance drive you mind is much more relaxed also 
37,37,7.0,0.91,"self, safer, full, tesla, musk, car, driver, human, data, road", i'm generally happier driving the car myself but if autopilot acted nicely it could be relaxing to have it help out driving a bit
