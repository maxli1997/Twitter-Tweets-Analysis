7,7,9.0,0.9437,"like, better, far, human, even, car, think, teslas, years, speak", hmm your reputation is not better than teslas autopilot is safer than human driving when you have data to prove otherwise please speak up and look less like a troll 
8,8,6.0,0.9526,"growth, fsd, better, okay, wasnt, car, full, self, power, rising", lane keeping cruise control and lane changing are great navigate on autopilot is okay the current software doesn't do full self-driving but the videos out there of those with the beta show it works much better but that remains to be seen until its rolled out to more people
9,9,5.0,0.955,"fsd, car, safer, technology, already, also, ceo, one, safe, pretty", well yea if you have the ceo on public saying that their autopilot is safer than humans driving and that the technology is already ready and in the cars rolling off the line that is misrepresentation is there evidence of bmw ceo making the same claims about their technology

12,12,3.0,0.9308,"self, full, tesla, drive, car, using, version, called, capability, cant", well autopilot that cant drive itself is not as bad as full self driving that cant drive itself but hey some things are more profound that it sounds
13,13,5.0,0.9526,"fsd, car, safer, technology, already, also, ceo, one, safe, pretty", not really not in my experience at least even with fsd capabilities the autopilot behaves pretty much the same only fsd beta often referred to as fsd by elon has significant differences in city driving
14,14,2.0,0.8714,"motional, self, birds, navigation, safer, via, derq, busy, vehicles, connectedcars",$tsla - how is teslas autopilot safe if drivers can hop in the backseat while it is driving 
15,15,6.0,0.9609,"growth, fsd, better, okay, wasnt, car, full, self, power, rising", no the rules are country specific if you see a car driving hands free it may be using fsd not autopilot those are extremely different capabilities the car in question didnt have fsd purchased fsd can be used without the lines
16,16,8.0,0.9667,"self, cars, dogepilot, end, tesla, full, way, fact, works, fsd", in some respects that is true my tesla does not have autopilot however with self-driving capabilities we can open up opportunities like car sharing eg less cars/impact/parking spaces/heat islands increased mobility options for folks living with disabilities etc 
17,17,4.0,0.9571,"conditions, success, easy, human, cant, compare, self, car, full, safer"," my point is you have to read more than the headline/title/name ""autopilot and full self-driving capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment while these features are designed /1"
18,18,3.0,0.9571,"self, full, tesla, drive, car, using, version, called, capability, cant","3 it is being suggested that this particular vehicle didn't have the most advanced version of autopilot --- called ""full self-driving capability"" --- installed that being said tesla may want to reconsider using terms like ""autopilot"" and ""full self-driving cspabulity "" 2/2 "
19,19,5.0,0.7,"fsd, car, safer, technology, already, also, ceo, one, safe, pretty", on autopilot and no-one driving outstanding 
20,20,7.0,0.9,"tesla, self, driver, fully, full, still, actually, better, tsla, like",tesla autopilot 'full self driving' update in the uk - how much better is it 2021 4 12 - youtube 
21,21,7.0,0.95,"tesla, self, driver, fully, full, still, actually, better, tsla, like",$tsla do i still need to pay attention while using autopilot yes autopilot is a hands-on driver assistance system that is intended to be used only with a fully attentive driver it does not turn a tesla into a self-driving 
22,22,4.0,0.925,"conditions, success, easy, human, cant, compare, self, car, full, safer", demonstrably safer - autopilot is only usable under easy driving conditions cant compare that success to human success under all conditions 
23,23,4.0,0.94,"conditions, success, easy, human, cant, compare, self, car, full, safer", stats are faulty in this case autopilot can only be used in very easy driving conditions you cant compare its success under easy conditions to human success under all conditions 
24,24,0.0,0.9625,"work, stressed, mind, events, car, job, possible, hr, know, fatigued",best thing about tesla autopilot when i have been flat out at work have a 1 hr long drive into the sun in heavy traffic i know the car is not fatigued not stressed and not distracted buy work events has its mind 100% on the job of driving as safe as possible 
25,25,9.0,0.9357,"like, better, far, human, even, car, think, teslas, years, speak", i think the outrage is maybe by taken the responsability during the drive autopilot may be better than traditional driving set but the driver is the leader in a car
26,26,8.0,0.94,"self, cars, dogepilot, end, tesla, full, way, fact, works, fsd",at this point should just rename autopilot into dogepilot prevents people from mistaking it as full self-driving but also just look at this beautiful design dogepilot off dogepilot on 
27,27,5.0,0.9437,"fsd, car, safer, technology, already, also, ceo, one, safe, pretty", autopilot is much safer if there is an accident the other driver that caused it must have done the most reckless driving because autopilot is so safe accidents shouldn't happen it will also only get better from here with updates 
28,28,8.0,0.9667,"self, cars, dogepilot, end, tesla, full, way, fact, works, fsd", the fact is though they do have full self driving cars fsd beta works and works really well totally different than autopilot regulation is standing in the way of innovation autopilot is safer than human drivers and thats a fact fsd will only make this gap bigger 
29,29,4.0,0.9591,"conditions, success, easy, human, cant, compare, self, car, full, safer","excerpt ""data logs recovered so far showed that autopilot wasnt engaged and that the owner of the car hadnt purchased a full self-driving option to enhance its functionality the chief executive officer said "" "

32,32,3.0,0.9471,"self, full, tesla, drive, car, using, version, called, capability, cant",autopilot on a plane does not = self-flying i fly the plane using a computer autopilot on a does not = self-driving you still drive the car but with a computer instead of the steering wheel that's what autopilot means 
33,33,3.0,0.94,"self, full, tesla, drive, car, using, version, called, capability, cant","if only there was a way to do that responsibly without marketing driving assistance beta software as ""autopilot"" and ""full self driving"" and having customers test it on public roads but nice attempt "
34,34,3.0,0.95,"self, full, tesla, drive, car, using, version, called, capability, cant"," ""tesla sells an enhanced version of autopilot called full self-driving capability for $10 000 although there is no car sold anywhere in the world today that is capable of full self-driving "
35,35,5.0,0.964,"fsd, car, safer, technology, already, also, ceo, one, safe, pretty", it was a tragedy yes but by statistics any tesla model is by far extremely more safe than any other car i can think of throw fsd or autopilot or even their active safety features mode on basically eliminating human input and you have a computer on wheels driving you around
36,36,5.0,0.9182,"fsd, car, safer, technology, already, also, ceo, one, safe, pretty", fud like this angers me autopilot is already safer than most drivers it also encourages me to slow down and relax when driving 
37,37,7.0,0.9471,"tesla, self, driver, fully, full, still, actually, better, tsla, like", the manual says that but tesla has a consistent drumbeat of marketing around the autopilot that makes it seem like it's just short of fully self-driving when it's actually decades away 
38,38,1.0,0.9609,"marelli, radar, systems, whst, driver, autonomous, every, accident, one, driven", in the 3rd quarter we registered one accident for every 4 59 million miles driven in which drivers had autopilot engaged for those driving without autopilot but with our active safety features we registered one accident for every 2 42 million miles driven 
39,39,6.0,0.8714,"growth, fsd, better, okay, wasnt, car, full, self, power, rising",okay sure autopilot wasnt on but do we know elon wasnt driving 
40,40,4.0,0.9526,"conditions, success, easy, human, cant, compare, self, car, full, safer", man - all kidding aside autopilot transforms the driving experience for me i actually drive to places i might otherwise fly to because i dont want to have to rent a car without autopilot crazy - maybe - but there it is 
41,41,9.0,0.9357,"like, better, far, human, even, car, think, teslas, years, speak", i'd like to see the video proof of this autopilot is far from perfect but i've never had that happen to me not even once in thousands of miles during two years of driving on autopilot
