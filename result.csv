2766,2766,4.0,0.4778,"tesla, full, self, work, drive, like, go, without, think, still", autopilot the self-driving feature is what will come when autosteer beta is up to really good reliability in the uk we gets hands-off driving on highways this year can watch netflix whilst it drives though it's only for traffic jams for now

4568,4568,2.0,0.9034,"self, tesla, full, fsd, people, like, cars, driver, car, tsla", no its currently saying human + autopilot is safer not just autopilot is safer the safety report specifically mentions driver with autopilot until we get full self driving miles data the current data implies that autopilot with human oversight is much safer 
4569,4569,1.0,0.5191,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars", it seems likely that autopilot was engaged in easy driving conditions e g highway with well-defined lane markings how do your statistics account for that

4595,4595,4.0,0.7206,"tesla, full, self, work, drive, like, go, without, think, still", no not even close i'd say supervising autopilot takes about 30% of the effort of actual driving you don't realize how much work your arms legs are doing until you use autopilot on a long distance drive you mind is much more relaxed also 
4596,4596,7.0,0.5347,"like, fsd, tesla, highway, dont, autonomous, really, know, already, im", tesla aims to reach l5 and they use another approach which can be a more general solution it is hard in early phase of autonomous driving development that's why not just waymo outperformed autopilot many companies with hd map solution also outperformed autopilot 
4597,4597,1.0,0.8956,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars", i don't think so driving with it on the 5s today to san clemente and there's this curve in the road that caused my tesla to oversteer and scare the crap out of drivers in adjacent lanes which made them honk for days autopilot is also not smooth with ac-/deceleration

4604,4604,2.0,0.6082,"self, tesla, full, fsd, people, like, cars, driver, car, tsla", nhtsa stats include a large amount of city driving where accidents happen more frequently per mile most tesla drivers limited autopilot use to highways where rates are much lower so you are comparing apples to oranges 
4605,4605,1.0,0.7299,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars", im a semi truck driver one day i was changing lanes i had a tesla behind me as i tracked into the right hand lane the tesla came with me then corrected autopilot tracking on semi or bad driving was kind of weird to see in my mirror 
4606,4606,1.0,0.5645,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars",i understand this data but i think you need to compare when autopilot is used mostly highways to car accidents when traditional cars are driving in the same conditions total average vehicle accidents against minimal autopilot accidents dont compare 
4607,4607,1.0,0.6714,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars", this article is about autopilot not the same as full self driving/auto steer all new teslas have autopilot but not all have auto steer autopilot uses gas and break but doesn't steer autopilot is one pull on the lever while auto steer is 2 pulls they are not he same

4610,4610,2.0,0.8254,"self, tesla, full, fsd, people, like, cars, driver, car, tsla", that's great at least people won't die much from accidents driving or in autopilot in a tesla car perfect definitely the best
4611,4611,7.0,0.5992,"like, fsd, tesla, highway, dont, autonomous, really, know, already, im", is the crash every 484 000 miles number based on city and highway driving autopilot is mostly used on highways it's not a fair comparison 
4612,4612,7.0,0.5867,"like, fsd, tesla, highway, dont, autonomous, really, know, already, im", agreed i own a tesla but i dont engage autopilot all the time usually im engaging it when im on the freeway in heavy traffic or in very light traffic so to compare w miles from a non tesla is comparing somewhat disimilar driving situations

4619,4619,1.0,0.6731,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars", autopilot is used on highways about 97% of the time accident rate on highways is about 1/25th that of normal on-road driving 
4620,4620,1.0,0.4712,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars", we should closely think about this data autopilot in its current form works well only on freeways/highways cars are less likely to collide when driving in their own lane imo stress free highway driving in itself is very useful but tesla should breakup this data by road type 
4621,4621,6.0,0.5785,"hands, free, wheel, gm, like, tesla, cadillac, need, even, one", i feel significantly safer on autopilot than i do my own driving 
4622,4622,2.0,0.9173,"self, tesla, full, fsd, people, like, cars, driver, car, tsla", their safety stats are based on mixed driving aka city and highway how about asking for the nhtsa accident rate for mixed that would be a far more direct comparison highway accident rates are lower but i'm sure we'd find out non autopilot mixed accidents would be higher 
4623,4623,2.0,0.4325,"self, tesla, full, fsd, people, like, cars, driver, car, tsla", yeah fair point love to see stats on apples to apples comparison if autopilot stats are from highway only active safety feature and wo either should also come from highway only but is autopilot stats only from highway driving i'm pretty sure i've seen videos of city street
4624,4624,1.0,0.4813,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars", i find such joy in driving the model s so passive autopilot features are greatly appreciated when im tired or anxious i e stop and go traffic navigate on autopilot is the best i am a safer driver because of tesla

4627,4627,6.0,0.5371,"hands, free, wheel, gm, like, tesla, cadillac, need, even, one", and this stat will continue to trend favoring autopilot humans tend not to learn from mistakes i e texting and driving drinking and drinking etc while developers and engineers can make continuous improvements to the autopilot system 
4628,4628,1.0,0.4957,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars", is this an apples-to-apples comparison teslas autopilot feature is only engaged in straight line driving on the highway whereas the nhtsa data incorporates all kinds of driving including more dangerous driving like left-hand turns city driving etc 
4629,4629,7.0,0.5128,"like, fsd, tesla, highway, dont, autonomous, really, know, already, im", we know that most driven mileage on autopilot driving is currently done as freeway driving and statistically we know that freeway driving is much safer than other roads therefore the inference that autopilot is safer than teslas standard safety suite cannot be supported 
4630,4630,1.0,0.8498,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars",to conclude you are almost 10x safer driving a tesla on autopilot than you are driving a non tesla without autopilot order now at to order the safest cars ever built

4637,4637,1.0,0.5235,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars", i suspect tesla's - evs in general - to be driven more yearly due to lower marginal costs hence dampening this positive effect on tesla insurance still autopilot is literally a life-saver and should be in every car driving 100% manually should become a thing of the past
4638,4638,4.0,0.8166,"tesla, full, self, work, drive, like, go, without, think, still", i recently did a trip from oregon down to az and back using autopilot makes it a pleasant drive no fatigue from driving 12hr legs btw got to stop at mother ship along the way 
4639,4639,7.0,0.5031,"like, fsd, tesla, highway, dont, autonomous, really, know, already, im", looks like some kind of survivorship bias logical mistake if we driving unsafe places we do it on our own but if we are going straight highway we do it by autopilot more miles - yes but that miles are safe by themselves 
4640,4640,1.0,0.5684,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars", just got my tesla yesterday and i can 100% confirm that driving with autopilot taac+autosteer engaged is a game changer for reducing stress levels while driving
4641,4641,7.0,0.501,"like, fsd, tesla, highway, dont, autonomous, really, know, already, im", mmm perhaps the selection of driving with autopilot is made when you have the best driving conditions less traffic good climate conditions etc then it could be a bad comparison if you do not take all this variables into account

4653,4653,4.0,0.4089,"tesla, full, self, work, drive, like, go, without, think, still", agreed i love autopilot too but i would never pay $10k to not drive my car i love driving while i see huge value for automation of trucking deliveries so on in day to day driving fsd is kinda pointless to me unless it's a crap handling toyota then fsd is fine 
4654,4654,4.0,0.5648,"tesla, full, self, work, drive, like, go, without, think, still", several hours try 30 mins or less and autopilot helps you do the driving so you arrive more relaxed

4679,4679,1.0,0.7487,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars", that said tesla autopilot does seem to allow for level 4 self-driving on highways as shown in the video below in which a passenger merely sits in the drivers seat the car drives itself 
4680,4680,1.0,0.5078,"car, tesla, driver, self, one, like, get, road, drive, cars", also what many people don't realise is that driving hands on with autopilot underneath is much more relaxing than having to control the car yourself on long drives especially you take over when necessary but mostly you are in monitoring mode
